# Summarization of the UCI _Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones_ Data Set #

To be submitted as part of the [Coursera](http://coursera.org)[Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) class.

When written, the root of the repository will contain a script called run_analysis.R that will do the following:

1. Merge the training (found in `input/train`) and the test sets (found in `input/test`) to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set (in `output/`) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
